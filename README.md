# PROJECT 3 - PING PONG

## Introduction
- In this lab activity, I used code provided by professor Freudenthal to create a ping pong game. Since the 
demo had code for creating shapes an bouncing of figures, I used those concepts as a base for the activity.
All this was achieved by changing dimensions and interactions for the figures to create the game.

## How to run
- In the main directory, run a make all. Then, go to shape-motion-demo folder and run make clean.
finally, run a make load and the game will start in the msp430

- switches s1 and s2 move green paddle left and right and s3 and s4 move the red paddle left and right.

- Any of the two players that score 4 points will win the game and a gameover followed by which player 
won will print in the screen.
